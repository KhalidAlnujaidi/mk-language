"""Planner/Composer — decomposes complex NL intents into ASG-parseable steps.

The thesis (from V03-PLAN.md §3): the ASG parser handles single-line intents with
rigid phrasing. The planner bridges the gap between how a human naturally describes
a multi-step task and the structured NL the parser expects.

Architecture (asymmetry thesis — ground truth beats model):
  1. Deterministic rules handle common compound intents (fast, no model).
  2. LLM fallback (Ollama) decomposes novel complex requests into structured NL.
  3. The existing parser + backends handle execution — the planner never executes.

Deterministic patterns:
  - Conjunction splitting: "create X and read X" → two lines
  - Sequential: "create X then read X" → two lines
  - Common compound intents: "backup NAME", "file info NAME", "init project NAME"
  - Pipeline: "read NAME, count lines, and sort" → ordered steps
  - Conditional: "ensure NAME exists", "touch NAME", "upsert NAME with TEXT"
  - Batch: "backup A and B", "inspect A then inspect B"

LLM fallback:
  - Prompted with the 16-node ASG vocabulary and their exact NL syntax
  - Returns one intent per line, each matching a known parse pattern
  - Output is validated: every line must parse to a non-None ASG node

# ASG vocabulary — the exact NL syntax the parser accepts
ASG_VOCABULARY = """\
The following intent types are ALL the parser understands. Every line you output
MUST match exactly one of these patterns (substitute actual values for the
uppercase placeholders):

  create file NAME with content "TEXT"      — create a new file (refuses overwrite)
  read file NAME                            — print file contents
  append "TEXT" to NAME                     — append text as new line
  count lines in NAME                       — print line count
  count words in NAME                       — print word count
  sort lines in NAME                        — print lines sorted alphabetically
  show first N lines of NAME                — print first N lines
  sum numbers in NAME                       — print sum of all integers in file
  extract lines matching "PATTERN" from NAME — print matching lines
  copy SRC to DEST                          — copy file (refuses if dest exists)
  make directory NAME                       — create directory
  move SRC to DEST                          — move file or into directory
  list files                                — list files in current dir
  list files in DIR                         — list files in a directory
  find files containing "TEXT"              — find files containing text
  delete NAME                               — refused unless confirmed
  delete NAME confirm                       — delete with confirmation
  if NAME exists then INTENT otherwise INTENT — conditional execution
  set VAR = INTENT                          — capture output of INTENT into VAR
  print $VAR                                — print the value of a variable
  replace "OLD" with "NEW" in NAME          — find & replace text in file
  uppercase NAME                            — convert to UPPERCASE
  lowercase NAME                            — convert to lowercase
  titlecase NAME                            — convert to Title Case
  unique lines in NAME                      — remove duplicate lines
  reverse lines in NAME                     — reverse line order
  show last N lines of NAME                 — print last N lines
  exclude lines matching "PATTERN" from NAME — print lines NOT containing pattern
  if $VAR op N then INTENT otherwise INTENT  — branch on variable comparison
    (op is one of: > < >= <= == !=)
  write "TEXT" to NAME                         — overwrite/create file (no refusal)
  overwrite NAME with "TEXT"                   — same as write
  compute EXPR                                — arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %, **, ())
  add $A and $B                               — shorthand for compute {A} + {B}
  subtract $A from $B                         — shorthand for compute {B} - {A}
  does NAME exist                             — same as exists
  exists NAME                                 — print 'yes' or 'no'
Variable substitution: any string field in later nodes can contain {VARNAME}
which gets replaced with the captured value. Example:
  set N = count lines in data.txt
  create file result.txt with content "Has {N} lines"
